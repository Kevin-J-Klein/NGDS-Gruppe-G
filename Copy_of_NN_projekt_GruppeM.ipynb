Hornberger   As US officials continue to accuse Russia of meddling with the US presidential election, an accusation that they have provided no evidence whatsoever to support, let\\u2019s review some of the US government\\u2019s history of meddling with elections in others countries.1. In 1951, the democratically elected parliament of Iran elected a man named Mohammad Mossadegh to be Iran\\u2019s prime minister. Mossadegh angered British Empire officials by nationalizing British oil interests in the country.British officials then turned to the CIA for assistance. In 1953, the CIA secretly fomented a violent coup in Iran, which succeeded in ousting Mossadegh from power and making the Shah of Iran the supreme unelected dictator of the country.To fortify the Shah\\u2019s dictatorial hold on power, the CIA helped organize and train the his domestic police force, the Savak, which was essentially a combination of the CIA, the NSA, and the military. Part of the CIA\\u2019s training involved teaching Savak agents the art of torture.For the next 26 years, the Iranian people suffered under one of the most brutal and tyrannical dictatorships in the world, one that US officials fully supported and called an ally and friend of the United States.In 1979, Iranians successfully revolted against the Shah\\u2019s regime and ousted him from power. One result was not a restoration of the democratic system that had elected Mossadegh but rather another brutal dictatorship, this time a religious one. Another result is the bad relations between the Iran and US governments that continues to exist today.2. In 1951, the Guatemalan people democratically elected a man named Jacobo Arbenz to be their president. Arbenz, however, was not satisfactory to US officials, especially the national-security branch of the government, specifically the Pentagon and the CIA. The reason that US officials opposed Arbenz was that he was a socialist, and US officials considered a socialist president of Guatemala to be a threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States.In 1954 \\u2014 one year after the coup in Iran, the CIA fomented a violent military coup that succeeded in removing Arbenz from power and replacing him with one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in Latin American history, a man named Carlos Castillo Armas. The CIA had a kill list prepared for the coup, which Arbenz was able to escape by fleeing the country before Castillo was able to get him. The CIA\\u2019s destruction of Guatemala\\u2019s democratic system threw the nation into a 30-year civil war that ended up killing millions of Guatemalan people, especially many of the poor.3. In 1960 a man named Patrice Lamumba was elected Congo\\u2019s first prime minister after independence from Belgium. Lamumba spoke out against Western imperialism and refused to take sides in the Cold War, which caused the CIA to conclude that he was a threat to \\u201cnational security.\\u201d The CIA orchestrated the assassination of Lamumba, which ended up taking place on January 17, 1961, just three days before President Kennedy, who liked Lamumba and who would have ordered the CIA to stand down, was to be sworn into office.4. In 1970 a man named Salvador Allende received a plurality of votes in the presidential election in Chile. Pursuant to the Chilean constitution, the election was thrown into the national congress. President Richard Nixon, his national-security team, the Pentagon, and the CIA concluded that because Allende believed in communism and socialism, he posed a grave threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States. The CIA attempted to bribe members of the congress to vote against Allende. It also orchestrated the kidnapping of the head of Chile\\u2019s armed forces, Gen Rene Schneider, who opposed a US military coup in his country, especially since a coup would violate the country\\u2019s constitution. The kidnapping attempt on Schneider left him dead.The CIA then fomented a coup that took place on 9/11 1973 that violently ousted Allende from power and left him dead. Replacing him was army Gen. Augusto Pinochet, one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in history. By the time Pinochet\\u2019s 17-year reign of military terror came to an end in 1990, he and his CIA-supported goons had incarcerated, raped, tortured, or killed tens of thousands of innocent people \\u2014 that is, people whose only \\u201ccrime\\u201d was believing in socialism \\u2014 with the full support of the CIA, Pentagon, Nixon, and his \\u201cnational security\\u201d team.Of course, there are also the more recent support of regime-change operations that ousted democratically elected presidents that the US government disapproved of, such as in Ukraine and Egypt.And then there is the long list of countries where unelected dictators were targeted for regime change by the US national security state and, where successful, replaced with a brutal unelected pro-US dictator. Cuba, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria all come to mind.US officials need to keep in mind that when they point their accusatory index finger at Russia for supposedly meddling in the US presidential election, US officials have, at the same time, three fingers pointing back at themselves.

Well, the three terrorists who attacked London Bridge over the weekend found the Black and Blue Steakhouse, and they found the toughest man in the house. [Or, maybe more to the point, he found them.  Roy Larner, 47, is a huge fan of the South East London soccer team Millwall F. C. The team is known as the Lions, and when   terrorists entered the Black and Blue to kill innocent people, Larner let them know who is the true king of the jungle. After the terrorists entered, with obvious bad intentions, Larner sprang into action: \\u201cLike an idiot I shouted back at them. I thought, \\u2018I need to take the p*** out of these b*****s.\\u2019 \\u201cI took a few steps towards them and said, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall.\\u2019 So they started attacking me. \\u201cI stood in front of them trying to fight them off. Everyone else ran to the back. I was on my own against all three of them, that\\u2019s why I got hurt so much. It was just me, trying to grab them with my bare hands and hold on. I was swinging. \\u201cI got stabbed and sliced eight times. They got me in my head, chest and both hands. There was blood everywhere. \\u201cThey were saying, \\u2018Islam, Islam!\\u2019 I said again, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u2019 \\u201cIt was the worst thing I could have done as they carried on attacking me. \\u201cLuckily, none of the blows were straight at me or I\\u2019d be dead. \\u201d A petition has begun, with the aim of awarding Larner with the George Cross for bravery. The award is the second highest commendation granted by Great Britain. Looking at his scars, it\\u2019s really hard to imagine that he won\\u2019t get it. If Millwall is looking for a new slogan, they may have found it. \\u201cF*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u201d has a nice ring to it.

He was caught using private email for work purposes while he was trying to take down Hillary Clinton for doing the same. And last week he flat out lied about an FBI letter in clear violation of federal law under the Hatch Act. But just when you think Chaffetz can\\u2019t be dirtier, it turns out his campaign is literally being funded by a criminal enterprise controlled by overseas investors. \\nThe single biggest campaign donor Jason Chaffetz is a company called Nu Skin Enterprises. Research done by Reverb Press has revealed that it adds up to nearly six figures in total, a surreal dollar amount for a fairly obscure company to give to a single Congressmen. But despite the lack of name recognition, Nu Skin is a billion dollar pyramid scheme which pushes questionable anti-aging miracle cures. And it\\u2019s been busted by the Feds for criminal behavior resulting in tens of millions of dollars in penalties. \\nBizarrely, Nu Skin Enterprises is now being bought up by overseas Chinese investors to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, placing the company largely under overseas control even as it\\u2019s begun its illegal business practices into China. Included in the investors list: family members of former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. So what does this all have to do with Congressman Jason Chaffetz? In short, a busted criminal pyramid scheme now controlled by Chinese political figures has been funding its very own member of Congress from the very start of his political career. In fact, before entering politics, Chaffetz used to be an employee of the company. With each new turn, the story grows stranger.

[The Justice and Development Party (AKP) leader levelled the accusation at Chancellor Angela Merkel personally, according to EU Observer, while addressing a rally in Istanbul.  \\u201cYou are right now employing Nazi measures,\\u201d he declared. \\u201cAgainst who? My Turkish brother citizens in Germany and brother ministers. \\u201d The   \\u201cModerate Islamist\\u201d was referring to the Merkel administration refusing to allow the AKP to organise political rallies in Germany ahead of a Turkish referendum on 16 April. Germany is home to around three million Turks, and Erdo\\u011fan has been keen to court them, as well as other European diaspora communities, in support of his bid to increase executive powers. Chancellor Merkel said the slurs broke \\u201cevery taboo\\u201d and disrespected genuine victims of the Nazis. She said she would consider revoking permissions for AKP campaign events which have already been granted if the insults continued. Erdo\\u011fan has shown no signs of deescalating his rhetoric, accusing the Germans of \\u201charbouring terrorists\\u201d from Turkey\\u2019s embattled Kurdish minority.

The President of the European Commission,   Juncker, attempted to downplay the threat, saying \\u201cit is not in Turkey\\u2019s interests to have smuggling rings and bandits in charge along its coast\\u201d.

            " b'as flying goes the only thing more uncomfortable than sitting next to a couple having a spat on an airplane maury rogoff learned is sitting between that couple  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   especially when one partner prefers bare feet ms rogoff who owns a public relations firm with offices in new york and florida and travels frequently discovered what a growing number of travelers now know the middle seat has become the third rail of flying  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   and it is getting harder to avoid as planes fly at record capacity and new cabin configurations squeeze in ever more passengers airlines are intentionally or not nudging fliers into paying extra to avoid drawing the proverbial short straw i was literally in the middle of their argument ms rogoff said it was just that awful  her discomfort was magnified when the husband kicked off his shoes and crossed his legs thrusting a bare foot into ms rogoffs space her entreaties with his wife to swap seats fell on deaf ears of course she had no interest because it was middle and because it was a smelly foot ms rogoff said for travelers like ms rogoff airlines are making it harder than ever to avoid the middle seat based on luck alone southwest which does not assign seats raised the price of an   pass to  from   last month for those who do not pay up it is a mad rush when online   opens  hours before the flight delta air lines basic economy fare introduced last year does not allow seat assignments to be made until after    \\xe2\\x80\\x94   when   customers have had a chance to claim window and aisle seats american airlines and united airlines plan to introduce similar fares this year neither would confirm whether selecting a seat would be one of the perks eliminated but one airline analyst said it was likely given the competition legacy airlines face from   carriers its a way to compete said max rayner a partner at hudson crossing a consulting firm in new york if you want to go at premium times there will be far fewer seats available at the lower end of prices  mr rayner suggested that this shift in pricing models wasnt necessarily a bad thing saying it could be a boon for the most   customers you can think of it actually as opening up choice he said you just want basic transportation  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   sure here it is  but the crunch has left some travelers taking extreme measures to avoid getting stuck in the middle fliers said they have offered fellow travelers money or drinks to switch seats paid the fee to upgrade to a premium or exit row feigned illness or switched flights some travelers even report buying two seats just to have an empty one next to them dr sachin shridharani a plastic surgeon in new york found himself on an overbooked flight back from san diego and a middle seat was the only one available i told them id be willing to take another flight he said ill pretty much do just about anything to avoid sitting in that notorious infamous middle seat  the   was to wait in the airport for four hours but dr shridharani said it was worth it so he could work on the way home you cant have someone looking over your shoulder he said in the end analysts say airlines are selling a form of real estate but they are trading in square inches not square feet people buy work space thats really what they buy on board said robert w mann jr an airline industry consultant some of those configurations may not give you enough room for example to take out a laptop and use it productively  one carrier though has tried to address the issue frontier airlines recently installed new seats on its airbus a and a planes with the middle seats about an inch wider than the window and aisle seats but for most passengers the tight squeeze continues and business travelers say counting on their   status to avoid the middle seat is no longer a sure thing you cant show up at the airport hoping to talk your way into an upgrade said mark jeffries a corporate speaker and author you dont see free seats anymore  mr jeffries said he sometimes buys two seats  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   a window or aisle and a middle its cheaper than buying a   or   ticket on a legacy carrier he said we find that people will pay for premium economy or any kind of seat assignment if theyre traveling solo to avoid the middle seat said julia douglas owner and president of jet set world travel in chicago some travelers will spend hundreds of dollars more she added another approach is to appeal to another traveler there have been instances where ive bought someone an upgrade said michael winston who used to travel once or twice a week while working in management consulting at times he said he had resorted to bargaining with seatmates to avoid the middle seat it is not an uncommon transaction frequent travelers say with cash upgrades and cocktails all serving as forms of currency but that is assuming that the seats are available last year airline capacity again hit a record high just shy of  percent meaning that a lot of flights are full and that leaves flight attendants and travel agents acting as de facto referees for games of midair musical chairs the excuses passengers use to avoid the middle seat are many they say long legs is always one ms douglas said she then listed the most common complaints claustrophobia a need for frequent trips to the bathroom   panic attacks and a penchant for airsickness i dont know if any of them are truly medically founded she said i just think its anxiety about being in that middle seat  of all the excuses genuine or exaggerated the one that seems most effective is the threat of gastrointestinal distress william bauer who travels frequently as an executive at a manufacturer of leather goods said that hinting at a medical need for quick access to the bathroom usually prompted either gate agents or fellow passengers to make the switch for him make it clear that you need that aisle seat really convey a compelling sense of urgency he said thus far ive never been rejected  on one recent flight though the tables were turned when mr bauer found himself on the receiving end of a plea to swap seats on a     flight there was a woman i gave up my aisle seat for because she cried he said if you cry you win'\n",
            " b'for the first time biologists have succeeded in growing human stem cells in pig embryos shifting from science fiction to the realm of the possible the idea of developing human organs in animals for later transplant the approach involves generating stem cells from a patients skin growing the desired new organ in a large animal like a pig and then harvesting it for transplant into the patients body since the organ would be made of a patients own cells there would be little risk of immune rejection the    pigs would be examples of chimeras animals composed of two different genomes they would be generated by implanting human stem cells into an early pig embryo resulting in an animal composed of mixed pig and human cells one team of biologists led by jun wu and juan carlos izpisua belmonte at the salk institute has shown for the first time that human stem cells can contribute to forming the tissues of a pig despite the  million years of evolution between the two species another group headed by tomoyuki yamaguchi and hideyuki sato of the university of tokyo and hiromitsu nakauchi of stanford has reversed diabetes in mice by inserting pancreas glands composed of mouse cells that were grown in a rat the salk teams report is published in thursdays issue of cell and the   teams in wednesdays issue of nature the two reports together establish the feasibility of trying to grow replacement human organs in animals though such a goal is still far off i think this is very promising work in principle said rudolf jaenisch a stem cell expert at the whitehead institute in cambridge mass many technical and ethical barriers have yet to be overcome but the research is advancing alongside the acute need for organs some   people in the united states alone are awaiting transplants creating chimeras especially those with human cells may prove controversial given the possibility that test animals could be humanized in undesirable ways one would be if human cells should be incorporated into a pigs brain endowing it with human qualities almost no one wants a talking pig another untoward outcome would be if human cells should come to compose the pigs reproductive tissues few people want to see what might result from the union between a pig with human sperm and a sow with human eggs in  senator sam brownback of kansas introduced a bill imposing a  million fine on anyone creating and profiting from a chimera with human cells in its brain or reproductive tissues that bill went nowhere but in deference to public concerns the national institutes of health in  instituted a moratorium on using public funds to insert human cells into animal embryos the n i h proposed last august to lift the ban but to require grant proposals involving the insertion of human stem cells into early animal embryos to be examined by an expert committee the public comment period on the proposal drew   responses that it reviewed  the ban is still in place and its unclear whether the trump administration would continue to consider lifting the moratorium or whether new objections would be raised to using public funds for this line of research we have no indication one way or another that they have any opinions on this said carrie d wolinetz the associate director for science policy at the n i h insertion of human stem cells into the early embryos of monkeys was prohibited in  and remains so because monkeys given their evolutionary closeness to humans might easily have their brains altered by human cells biologists interest in chimeras has been prompted by the limited success in coaxing medically useful tissues from stem cells grown in glassware   human stem cells were first derived from human embryos in  and from ordinary adult tissue cells in  after each discovery there were hopes of converting the cells into therapeutic tissues by exposing them in glassware to the sequence of natural chemicals that in the living embryo directs them into constructing the heart brain lungs and other organs but no one knows exactly what sequence of chemicals is required for the generation of each different tissue or organ this may be why glassware experiments with stem cells have not yet lived up to their full promise some biologists believe a better approach may be to grow stem cells not in glassware but in a developing embryo where they will be exposed to the natural sequence of chemicals required to induce each type of organ in the last  years hundreds of labs including ours have tried to generate different cell types from human pluripotent stem cells in the culture dish with a cocktail of factors dr izpisua belmonte said but the cocktails are not identical to what the cells experience in the embryo so i thought why not let nature do the job  dr izpisua belmontes and dr nakauchis teams have both pursued a strategy of directing the human donor cells to generate specific organs in the recipient species this is desirable for both technical and ethical reasons dr nakauchi has disabled the master gene in rats for making a pancreas so that when mouse stem cells are injected into the early embryo of such a rat the growing embryo has no choice but to construct its pancreas of pure mouse cells instead of the usual mixture of rat and mouse cells generating inviting homes for the donor cells may reduce the risk that they will be incorporated in nontarget tissues like the brain or reproductive tissues also an organ made purely of donor cells can be transplanted into the donor animal with minimal fear of rejection in practice about  percent of the mouse pancreases generated in rats was composed of rat cells because the rat supplies the blood vessels for the organ but the rat blood vessels seem to be quickly replaced when the organs are transferred to mice the mice with their new pancreases lived in good health for a year after the transplant they came from the same inbred strain as the donor mice so they did not reject their new organs the result provides proof of principle that type  diabetes can be treated by growing a pancreas from an individuals cells in another animal dr nakauchi and colleagues conclude the next step is to repeat the experiment in pigs which produce organs of a more suitable size for use in humans dr izpisua belmontes team has now shown that human stem cells do survive in pig embryos and help form their organs although not very efficiently the human cell doesnt contribute much to the brain we observed little or no contribution at all said his colleague dr wu this is good news because we can guide the human cells to the organ we want  both dr izpisua belmonte and dr nakauchi said there was a long way to go before human organs could successfully be grown in animals like pigs chimeras will be more immediately useful in studying human embryogenesis testing drugs and following the progress of disease to achieve the goal of growing human organs for transplant researchers must first engineer pigs that cannot make the organ of interest in mice this has already been done for the pancreas heart and eye they must then show that human stem cells can construct such an organ in a pig since the pig will supply the blood vessels and nerves these will need to be replaced by the recipients cells after transplant without triggering immune rejection if rejection does occur the researchers will have to knock out the pigs vasculature genes and arrange for these too to be humanized complex organs like the heart will be harder to grow than those like the pancreas which has a single kind of progenitor cell all these steps though they seem feasible will require several years to develop and test both scientists expressed confidence that ethical concerns about chimera research could be addressed chimeras are typically mosaics in which each organ is a mixture of the host and donor cells but new techniques like the   gene editing system should allow the human cells in a pig embryo both to be channeled into organs of interest and to be excluded from tissues of concern like the brain and reproductive tissues this isnt dangerous research were not creating monsters dr nakauchi said there isnt a need to get into a debate about moral humanization if scientists target the organs where the human cells will go said insoo hyun a medical ethicist at case western reserve university scientists are not making chimeras just for fun  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   its to relieve the dire shortage of transplantable organs  concern about human cells incorporation into a lower animals brain is not without basis dr steven goldman of the university of rochester medical center found in  that mice injected with a special type of human brain cell had enhanced learning abilities but other forms of humanized mice such as mice engineered to have a human immune system are routine laboratory animals that seem to occasion little angst dr izpisua belmontes insertion of human stem cells into pig embryos was not affected by the n i h moratorium on such chimeras because he used private funds his experiment was approved by the authorities in spain and in california and following their advice the development of the pig chimeras was stopped after four weeks in the womb dr nakauchi moved his lab to stanford from tokyo in  because japanese regulations do not allow chimera research only to be hit with the n i h moratorium a year later which prevented him from making chimeras with human cells his mouse pancreas experiment has taken eight or nine years to complete i have been in a very frustrating situation he said'\n",

forthcoming pitches for much of the  season through a scheme in which the giants used a telescope in the polo grounds   clubhouse to pick up opposing catchers signals details of the   were publicly revealed by joshua prager in the wall street journal in  and in his book the echoing green in  thomson who died at age  in august  always maintained he was not tipped that branca would be throwing a fastball on what became that fateful home run pitch but branca was convinced otherwise when you took signs all year and when you had a chance to hit a bloop or hit a home run would you ignore that

            " b'email director of the federal bureau of investigation fbi james comey is again under fire this time by supporters of hillary clinton for permitting the reopening of the investigation into her use of personal servers to store and send classified material the second round of a scandal that could prove fatal to the democratic nominees chance to occupy the oval office in january republicans had their own go at comey when he declared after the original investigation of clintons mishandling of classified documents and information that there was insufficient evidence to charge her with any criminal violation comey it seems has become a punching bag being worked over by partisans on both sides of the political aisle regarding the sound and fury coming out of the clinton camp they dont see that their candidate has fallen into a pit she dug for herself she knew or should have known that there are rules governing the treatment and transmission of data that could place us national security in danger she broke those rules and despite what comey claimed whether she did so knowingly or not is irrelevant as the requisite mental state codified into the regulation is negligence that is to say in order to be in violation of the relevant statute one need only fail to take reasonable care in the behavior in question it is beyond dispute that there was a duty of care and hillary clintons behavior fell well below that bar what is also beyond dispute is that neither the republicans \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when clinton was exonerated \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or the democrats \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when the whole affair was brought back into the light of investigation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 ever questioned the authority of the fbi to carry on as a federal police force the larger question the constitutional question is why does the federal government have an armed police force with nearly unlimited authority at home and abroad and with the power to conduct most of its work in secret beyond the oversight of the american people whose interest they ostensibly serve perhaps ryan mcmaken has hit upon the answer to that question in an article published on the mises wire blog mcmaken writes of the federal governments law enforcement agency of all federal police forces the fbi is the most romanticized and every fbi agent is assumed to be the modern embodiment of a fictionalized version of eliot ness incorruptible professional and efficient decades of pop culture has driven this home with tv series and movies such as the untouchables  the fbi story  and this is your fbi have long perpetuated the idea that when local police fail the fbi will step in to be more effective and simply better than every other law enforcement agency corruption cannot touch the fbi we are told and they apply the law equally to everyone according to a piece penned in  a stasi for america reporter james bovard painted a darker less egalitarian picture of the fbis application of the law a ripple of protest swept across the internet in late march after the disclosure that the federal bureau of investigation was teaching its agents that the fbi has the ability to bend or suspend the law to impinge on the freedom of others this maxim was inculcated as part of fbi counterterrorism training the exposure of the training material \\xe2\\x80\\x94 sparked by a series of articles by wiredcoms spencer ackerman \\xe2\\x80\\x94 spurred the ritual declaration by an fbi spokesman that mistakes were made and we are correcting those mistakes no fbi officials were sanctioned or fired for teaching lawmen that they were above the law at least the fbi has been consistent since its founding in  the bureau has rarely let either the statute book or the constitution impede its public service tim weiner the author of a superb expos\\xc3\\xa9 of the cia  legacy of ashes  has delivered a riveting chronology of some of the fbis biggest crimes with his new book enemies  theres no question that in its roughly  years of existence the fbi has seen its reputation rise and fall mcmaken recites a bit of recent history in support of his assertion that the creation and the continuation of the fbi as a federal secret police force is an assault on the liberty of the united states the reality and the romance of course have always been two totally different things and its helpful to remind ourselves that it was the fbi that was in charge of the waco massacre where  children were killed it was the fbi that led the raid on randy weavers house where an fbi sniper shot a woman dead while she was holding a month old baby it was the fbi that spied on martin luther king jr and targeted peaceful antiwar organizations for political reasons during the s and s it was the fbi that came of age arresting opponents of the first world war naturally in all of these cases the fbi has actively covered up the facts and denied wrongdoing next the history lesson looks further back to the beginnings of the fbi to illuminate the transformation of the fbi from crimefighting force albeit no less unconstitutional to powerful partner in the surveillance state thanks to war hysteria during world war i the fbi rose to prominence as woodrow wilsons shock troops against dissidents ie peaceful opponents of the war indeed persecuting and prosecuting political enemies of the american state would become something of the forte of the fbi with the role of the agency being expanded ever more during times of perceived national crisis the idea of the fbi as a crimefighting organization \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the primary message of fawning treatments of the fbi such as the untouchables and the fbi story \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for decades served as cover for the fbis political activities as foreign policy pointed out in  though the fbi quietly dropped its claims of being a crime fighting organization and began declaring itself a national security organization down the memory hole goes the fbis original claimed raison detre this point is borne out in the fbis own description of its purpose on the questions and answers section of its official web page the agency describes itself as an intelligencedriven and threatfocused national security organization with both intelligence and law enforcement responsibilities where one wonders does the constitution grant the federal government or any of its associated agencies any intelligence gathering and federal lawenforcement power finally not only is the fbis assumption of its current role as federal police force and armed branch of the federal surveillance apparatus unconstitutional and a persistent threat to freedom but it represents yet another example of the inability of the government to perform any task on par with a privately owned entity with the same or similar objective again from the mises wire the unreliability of metropolitan police with their strong local and partisan ties prompted major businesses and industrialists to establish the pinkertons and other private police forces the pinkertons ultimately functioned as a de facto national detective and policing service until the s when the fbi finally came into its own as one scandal blends into the next and as each generation sees the occurrence of some serious act of fbi abuse of power perhaps it is time to consider the abolition of the agency

inspiring fireside chatsthe ugly truth some economists argue that fdrs measures prolonged the great depression  all the new deal programs were struck down as unconstitutional except social security he got the supreme court to back off by threatening to pack the court with more members with views to his liking that restrained their judicial opinion though the constitution doesnt grant congress the power to create a federal retirement systemsocial security works\\xe2\\x80\\x94though its slim pickings if its a retirees only income\\xe2\\x80\\x94and for decades the surplus has been a cash cow offsetting congressional overspending  however the aging baby boomers who didnt have enough children might turn the cash cow into an albatross further the social security number is now a defacto universal id number a convenient database field for monitoring citizens  americas founding fathers would have been appalled at todays domestic spying  and the soviet dictators of old would have wept with envyfdr pledged to keep the usa out of wwii  meanwhile he quietly did everything possible to antagonize japan a oncefriendly nation such as among several items freezing their assets and cutting off their oil supply when he got intelligence of the upcoming attack on pearl harbor he didnt order the base to be locked and loadedif that wasnt bad enough so nearly a quarter million americans died in battle but at least the pivotal intervention came just in time to make the world safe for democracy right unfortunately fdr was far too friendly with the ussr giving them nearly  billion in food weaponry and other supplies about  billion adjusted for inflationat the yalta conference fdr agreed to let uncle joe stalin take over eastern europe general patton wanted to press forward at full speed to keep as much territory as possible away from soviet tyranny but politics hampered him every step of the way until he got rubbed out  when the iron curtain rose and the cold war began winston

journalist  spinning the news for decades sometimes it was rather subliminal including his signature subtle sneer most of the public then believed journalists were muckrakers and unbiased truthtellers as cronkites tagline went and thats the way it isuntil cronkites late career the mainstream media had a veneer of respectability\\xe2\\x80\\x94perhaps like warped plastic barely sticking to crumbling particleboard but a veneer nonetheless there once were only three american corporate tv networks from manhattan they were the publics information gatekeepers no other broadcast news besides shortwave radio was available baby boomer liberals might get a bit mistyeyed remembering those days today six megaconglomerates own  of the media but at least the internet lets us present our own perspectives and call out biased reporters if that wasnt bad enough  his biggest whopper was about the tet offensive the viet cong launched a desperate allout assault suffered very heavy losses mostly it was over within a day and ultimately the vc gained no territory however the most trusted man in america gave them a propaganda victory reporting that the vietnam war was hopeless public opinion promptly turned against the war ho chi minh shouldve given cronkite a medal an honorary vc generalship and a dozen rosesmany forget that the  paris accords brought peace two years later though the shaky ford

underwaterafter a night of partying on chappaquiddick island ted kennedy drove off a bridge he escaped but failed to help his passenger mary jo kopechne per one of the investigators she suffocated slowly in an air pocket for about two hours if hed ran to a nearby house for help\\xe2\\x80\\x94rather than waiting nine hours to sober up\\xe2\\x80\\x94she wouldve survived he got a two month suspended sentence barely a slap on the wrist for vehicular manslaughter the judge basically said poor teddy had suffered enough what about how miss kopechne suffered theres one set of rules for the elites  and another for us shortly thereafter he tried to spindoctor it with a woe is me shtick the suckers kept reelecting him though a presidential bid was now beyond reachas for his many legislative actions the immigration and nationality act of  was the most notorious he promised the public first our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually under the proposed bill the present level of immigration remains substantially the same\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 secondly the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 contrary to the charges in some quarters the bill will not inundate america with immigrants from any one country or area or the most populated and deprived nations of africa and asia\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 in the final analysis the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 the bill will not flood our cities with immigrants it will not upset the ethnic mix of our society it will not relax the standards of admission it will not cause american workers to lose their jobs the lion of the senate was lyin his fat ass off this population replacement policy threatens americas future  just as the coudenhovekalergi plan is doing in europe still the suckers kept reelecting himif that wasnt bad enough besides giving away the country to which the constitution granted the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity  lyin ted was in cahoots with the kgb  he proposed to help his soviet pal yuri andropov with tidying up the ussrs image problem during the cold wars endgame the damning documents suggested that walter cronkite see above and barbara walters might be used for this effort conservatives often suspect liberals are soft on communism little did they know how cozy ted kennedy was in bed with comrade andropovjohn lennon how the world remembers he was a talented musician arguably the most prominent of the beatles their story was an archetypal garage band becoming a bar band and eventually breaking out into great fame lennon produced dozens of hits that still get air play hes remembered as a wonderful man an embodiment of the s the good parts  anyway and the conscience of the worldthe ugly truth despite lennons considerable talents not all his songs were excellent things slipped with the white album  revolution  really after the beatles broke up he started a solo career often featuring songs with sophomoric political poses his last album produced during his life\\xe2\\x80\\x94after dragging himself out of a long heroin stupor\\xe2\\x80\\x94was double fantasy  critics at first agreed that it sucked after a nut shot lennon they felt sorry for him and declared it brilliantlennon was the archetypal leftist celebrity using fame to push politics granted everyone has a right to their opinion but being able to sing or act confers no special political expertise his song imagine is particularly telling as he put itimagine that there was no more religion no more country no more politics is virtually the communist manifesto even though im not particularly a communist and i do not belong to any movementbeing under the shadow of the berlin wall back in their bar gig days shouldve precluded sophomoric posturing like thisif that wasnt bad enough his failings are quite troubling too numerous to fully detail one item is abandoning his family the way his own father did a truly wonderful man wouldnt do thatanother item was his extensive substance abuse he spent  guzzling booze his lost weekend one night a waitress refused service because he stuck a menstrual pad on his head thenlennon do you know who i amwaitress yeah youre some asshole with a kotex on his foreheadone lennon biographer asked timothy leary whod been on hundreds of acid trips what lennons extreme lsd consumption would do leary had no idea finally what kind of inner vacuum caused this highly successful musician much beloved by the public to get himself strung out on heroinjimmy carter in this heartwarming scene jimmy carter and uncle fidel stand for the cuban national anthem in havanahow the world remembers carter is praised as a rare honest politician exemplifying christian principles and tolerancethe ugly truth the economy tanked during the carter administration doubledigit inflation and high unemployment economists are still puzzled by stagflation normally unemployment and inflation are inversely correlated at least obama gave economists another data point to studycarters commendably not corrupt but exemplified bleedinghearted liberalism despite winning the nobel peace prize for not being george w bush likewise al gore and the lightworker carter was a lackluster embarrassment he was known for tmi statements for example about his hemorrhoids and committing adultery in his heart at least clinton had the balls to do it for real he ranked lower than mr whipple on a face recognition survey the boston globe reported on one of his speeches with the headline more mush from the wimp finally journalists got something rightcarters shining foreign policy moment was the camp david accords establishing peace between egypt and israel america started giving over a billion annually to each party for making peace which ironically supplies their military why the usa wasnt even a combatant aside from the uss liberty incident which certainly shouldnt inspire american tribute money taxpayers still fund this absurd protection racketworse he badly bungled the iran hostage crisis one iranian official later stated they wouldve released the hostages if the usa had threatened force in the beginning yep carter failed irans shit test consequentially the usa lost tons of international prestige and the ordeal of the hostages dragged on unnecessarilyif that wasnt bad enough carter is often a little too cordial with notorious dictators  worse clinton trusted him to represent the usa during disarmament talks with north korea they gave him the potemkin village show he bought it hook line and sinker yet again carter was played for a chump\\xe2\\x80\\x94the usa opened its wallet and gave north korea aid and

            " b'posted by matthew bernstein  nov    american strength washington not russia was responsible if you are been paying attention to what the democrats are saying this election in terms of the hacks they will tell you that its all part of a plot that involves donald trump and russia every top democrat from hillary clinton to barack obama has argued that they have been saying this ever since the first hacks on the democratic national committee happened back in july and they have continued that claim with every hack that has happened since most recently they have been saying that the hacks on clintons campaign chairman john podesta were part of yet another russian hack they have claimed that the hacks were done in order to influence the election in favor of trump not everyone believes that lie in fact there are people out there that think that the source of the hack has come from the united states government one person that believes that is former british ambassador craig murray he says that the source of the podesta leaks was a washington insider rather than someone from russia that would mean that clintons campaign is continuing to make a false claim on a foreign country murray told sputnik the source of these emails and leaks has nothing to do with russia at all i discovered what the source was when i attended the sam adams whistleblower award in washington the source of these emails comes from within official circles in washington dc you should look to washington not to moscow that means that there is someone in washington that is doing what he or she can to end the corruption of the clintons and yet her camp continues to claim that someone within russia did it because that is a phenomenal way to create peace between two nations that have nuclear weapons someone in washington is trying to make sure hillary doesnt win but that wasnt the only thing that murray went on to destroy he went on to blast the democrats other narrative that wikileaks is a source for russia he has said that such claims are designed to divert attention from the content of the material that means that they are hiding something if they are spending this much time trying to change the story wikileaks also decided to mock the clinton campaigns literal obsession with conspiracy theories with a tweet they said no link between trump  russia no link between assange  russia but podesta  clinton involved in selling  of us uranium to russia this tweet was in reference to the fact that the fbi found nothing of substance that connected donald trump to russia they literally said that he had no clear link to russia so once again the democrats attempt to say something like that is proven false that also means that if the democrats continue to blame trump for this supposed russian hack on their servers then they are definitely hiding something because the fbi has cleared trump of any connection to russia and now there is a former british ambassador that has said that the hacks were coming from someone located in washington and there are other claims to back that up there was a youtube video that was released and has gone viral in it former deputy assistant secretary of state steve pieczenik is talking about how there are people in the united states government are doing what they can to prevent clinton from becoming president of the united states he has said that members of the united states government including the fbi and the cia have initiated a countercoup through julian assange and wikileaks in order to stop hillary clinton from becoming president of the united states pieczenik has also said that assange has released emails that we gave to him in order to undermine hillary and bill clinton that is two former high ranking members of their respective governments saying that the leak has come from washington and not russia like the democrats want you to believe but it goes even further than that what murray has said is true they are doing whatever they can to have the people of the united states not look at those emails that were released the democrats continue to blame russia for the hacks because that is a great foreign policy tactic that is because those emails have shown that the democrats are engaging in some highly illegal activity from all the leaks that we have seen the democrats have engaged in election rigging paytoplay operations and cheating in several different debates but of course when you try and confront them on this they will attempt to say that russia was behind it or that trump was behind it one of the excuses that they have also given has come from interim chairwoman of the democratic national committee donna brazile during the second hack of the dnc back in july she attempted to scare people from reading the hacked emails by saying that they could possibly be infected with malware  really if you are making this big an attempt to stop people from reading them then you are obviously hiding something of course brazile was mentioned in those wikileaks emails as well she was guilty of giving clinton a question that was going to appear in a town hall and when someone called her out on it brazile attempted to say that she was being  persecuted  its not persecution if the answer is right in front of you you were literally doing what you could to help out clinton as much as possible share this article to show that there are people out there that believe that the hacks on the democratic party are coming from washington itself rather than russia and considering that the democrats continue to blame russia for the hacks means that they are just damaging the foreign relationships even more that is not something that the united states can afford anymore we need people that are going to work on making our relationships with foreign governments better not worse we also need people that are going to lead the people and not have to answer to more corruption charges this is why we need donald trump'\n",
            " b'by michael snyder end of the american dream  if you want to see war without end vote for hillary clinton it is tremendously ironic that hillary clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray donald trump as dangerous and temperamental because it is clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable she has a temper that is absolutely legendary and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades  hillary clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in syria thanks to her libya is a postapocalyptic wasteland today and now she is picking a fight with the russians before she has even won the election of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as hillary clinton and if she wins the election i am fully convinced that world war  will begin before her time in the white house is over someone that shares this opinion with me is donald trump according to reuters  trump recently stated that we are going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 on syrias civil war trump said clinton could drag the united states into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict clinton has called for the establishment of a nofly zone and safe zones on the ground to protect noncombatants some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the united states into direct conflict with russian fighter jets what we should do is focus on isis we should not be focusing on syria said trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his trump national doral golf resort youre going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton in order to have a nofly zone in syria you would have to enforce it and in order to enforce it you would have to be willing to shoot at the russians according to national intelligence director james clapper  that could have dire consequences\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 russia could shoot down a us aircraft if a nofly zone were imposed over syria national intelligence director james clapper said tuesday i wouldnt put it past them to shoot down an american aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground clapper said speaking with cbs charlie rose at the council on foreign relations in new york about several national security issues of course clapper is not alone in that assessment the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general joseph francis dunford says that imposing a nofly zone over all of syria would require us to go to war \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 right now senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria it would require us to go to war against syria and russia\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make  senate armed services committee september   emphasis added but hillary clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants you see the truth is that hillary clinton wants to win the war that she started in syria back in  she spearheaded an effort along with saudi arabia and turkey to try to use the arab spring uprisings in the middle east as an opportunity to try to overthrow president assad in syria if it wasnt for her meddling millions of refugees would not be pouring into europe and elsewhere and there would be no humanitarian crisis in syria at all thanks to russian intervention the war in syria is not too far from being over but the obama administration is desperate to keep it going they understand that if assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted and that is why they are so determined to keep aleppo from falling without aleppo many of the jihadist rebels that the obama administration has been supporting wont have anywhere to hide so the obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the syrian military and the russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen  if obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against syrian forces and the russians start shooting back that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control one recent survey found that current american leadership has a  percent approval rating in russia right now and the russians dislike hillary clinton even more than they dislike barack obama the russians know that if hillary clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us and that is why they desperately want donald trump to win in november you can see this outlook reflected in comments that russian president vladimir putin recently made about the two candidates \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 mrs clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country against russia mr trump on the other hand calls for cooperation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism putin said naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us and we consider it wrong that we always have to be in conflict with one another creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world putin noted anyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that hillary clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for russia the thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate but it may soon become a reality and even now the obama administration and our nato allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with moscow this week it is being reported that nato troops will soon be sent to poland estonia latvia and lithuania \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 nine hundred us troops are to be sent to eastern europe next year as americas troubled relationship with russia enters new uncertain territory a usled battle group of nato allied soldiers will be sent to poland as part of the multination operation british forces will lead one of the four battle groups in estonia canada will spearhead the presence in latvia and germany will be present in lithuania in addition infowars is reporting that us marines will soon be stationed in norway near the border with russia\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 after accepting a pentagon proposal norway will host us marines at a base near the russian border as russia deploys nuclearcapable ships to kaliningrad a rotating force of approximately  marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of vaernes just outside trondheim beginning in january norway and russia share an mile border in the arctic the us initiative to augment their training and exercises in norway by locating a marine corps rotational force in norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship said norwegian defense minister ine eriksen s\\xc3\\xb8reide most americans arent aware of any of this nor do they really care about our relationship with russia but in russia things are completely different the possibility of war with the united states is the biggest news story over there these days  and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 russian authorities have stepped up nuclearwar survival measures amid a showdown with washington dusting off sovietera civildefense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities at the kremlins ministry of emergency situations the cold war is back the country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the ussr with what officials said were  million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats i know that i have been writing about this over and over  but the truth is that we are on a path to war with russia and the election of hillary clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war'\n",
            " b'still not thanking native americans november   returned to its historical roots thanksgiving would be a day to express thanks to native americans whose generosity saved the pilgrims but that never seems to be a lesson learned as dennis j bernstein reports on the dakota pipeline standoff by dennis j bernstein late sunday night \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at the start of thanksgiving week \\xe2\\x80\\x94 native american protesters were attacked by law enforcement agents near the site of the dakota access pipeline a project that native americans and environmentalists have been trying to block police and other security forces deployed tear gas rubber bullets percussion grenades and water hoses to stop about  protesters from crossing the blackwater bridge on state highway  about a mile from an uncompleted section under lake oahe a missouri river reservoir where work has been on hold by order of federal agencies as medical professionals we are concerned for the real risk of loss of life due to severe hypothermia under these conditions the standing rock medic  healer council said in a statement posted on facebook one hundred sixtyseven people were injured and seven were taken to the hospital according to jade begay a spokeswoman for the indigenous environmental network protest against the dakota access pipeline in st paul minnesota on september   fibonacci blue flickr sundays standoff began around  pm local time when a group of about  water protectors attempted to clear burned out trucks that were blocking the bridge which is on the most direct route from the standing rock sioux reservation to bismarck north dakota the trucks have been in place for several weeks and law enforcement has constructed a barricade behind them forcing all traffic to take an approximately mile detour the purpose of this action was to do something to remove that barricade because its dangerous said begay a member of the tesuque pueblo and din\\xc3\\xa9 who has been at the standing rock encampments since september that barricade poses a danger not just to everyone at the camp but also to cannon ball and other communities that are south theyre using that barricade as an excuse for us not to be able to lawfully protest said frank archambault a member of the standing rock sioux tribe from little eagle south dakota we got word that the drill is now on the pad so tensions are high right now the mile fourstate pipeline is intended to carry oil from western north dakota to a shipping point in illinois but construction of the  billion pipeline has been protested for months by the standing rock sioux whose reservation lies near the pipeline route and there are fears a leak could contaminate the drinking water they also worry that construction could threaten sacred sites cheryl

construction spray protesters with pepper spray photo by tim yakaitis cheryl angel im a member of the rosebud sioux tribe i am sasusaku lakota i currently live at cannonball to support standing rock in their efforts to save the water that millions of americans depend upon on the evening of november  th  after a day of prayer and ceremony at all three camps our security attempted to open the bridge by removing the burnt out trucks that the north dakota authorities had put there themselves and had started on fire themselves and left on the bridge so our security forces tried to remove them from the bridge and the north dakota authorities then decided to escalate their presence by calling in a militarized vehicle and im going to say \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 maybe  more law enforcement vehicles there were so many you couldnt even count them you need to understand that \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 what separates the tribe from the pipeline area thats being excavated is the cannonball river at some points its about  feet wide at other points its only  feet wide but there is a bridge that connects between those two lands those two boundaries and thats where the armored vehicles were parked that were already burnt out dennis bernstein and in terms of what happened\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 we understand that a number of people were wounded with these tear gas canisters we understand that they were using water hoses in i guess  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  degree fahrenheit weather tell us more about that kind of violence so people can really you know get a human face on whats going on there ca i felt like i was in a war zone i had \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 been called to a meeting so i was heading for the meeting i could hear young warriors running through the camps saying everybody to the north bridge so everybody answered the call they got in their vehicles and they drove to the north bridge so both sides of the road had cars facing north people were walking on the sides of the road the dapl dakota access pipeline being installed between farms as seen from th avenue in new salem north dakota august   tony webster flickr i had taken a back path that the deer the wildlife use and i entered from between two hills on a deer path and i walked through the trees up along the fence and then from that point on \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 there was flood lights there was at least  floodlights on the north side of the river about a quarter mile apart along the entire path of that pipeline so its like moonlight\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 its like daylight on the north side of the river on the south side not so much and people had gathered there they had\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 they were singing at the front line they were playing music at the front line they were chanting water is life by the time i had gotten there people were coming back soaked in water and it was really cold out and the wind had picked up and truckloads of people with assistance had brought blankets and jackets and water and goggles and face masks so when you entered the bridge you could look to your right and pick up a blanket and pick up a goggle and pick up a face mask and you could walk further to where the encounter was taking place so i kept to the right of the bridge and i went down to where the razor wire is because its like a war zone there im not kidding they have floodlights they have the tank right centered on the bridge and there was no instructions they \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 had a water cannon there i heard throughout the night that they had used seven fire engine trucks they emptied seven of them it was unbelievable i didnt think that they would continue to water cannon people and i asked them\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 i went to the front lines and said stop this\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 please go home were here praying for you well find you new jobs pray with us stand with us were protecting the water for millions and they didnt listen they stood behind the barbed wire and they continued \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 they would lift their rifles and they would pick out literally pick out individuals in the crowd and they would shoot them and so water protectors had plastic container tops and they were using those as shields and they were protecting people whenever they could i was on the front line i was very very lucky because i didnt get shot i got maced i got peppered sprayed i got water cannoned a woman holds a sign protesting the dakota access pipeline opposite side reads water is life washington dc november   photo by chelsea gilmour the force of a water cannon if you havent had one\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 it knocks you off your feet and we had built fires to warm up the people who were soaking wet in the frigid weather people are shaking they were drenched in water and tear gas our medics were out there in full force doing what was necessary to keep people breathing people were sharing their inhalers those who couldnt breathe\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 it was unbelievable i didnt think that things would come to this end but unless obama stands up unless people start calling their senators our lives are in danger not only the water but our lives are physically in danger so it hurts me to talk like thisbut a call needs to be made hundreds of calls need to be made our water needs to be protected we need support up here we need wool blankets we need wool clothes we need to replenish our first aid kits we need more thermal blankets we need batteries we need jerky we need those snack bars that you eat when youre not able to eat a hot meal thermoses we need\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 i think we need hundreds of thermoses because we cant even carry hot water with us anywhere we go it was just unbelievable it was\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 between being shot with water and then dodging bullets im trying to deliver a peaceful message and saying prayer it was hard i mean i slid down the hill i was knocked off the hill by a water cannon people picked me up there was a man standing right next to \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 a military vehicle without any face protection without any blanket and he was singing and he kept singing and they just kept spraying him over and over i picked up an army blanket i covered him up with it i stood beside him we sang together we prayed together and they still shot at us they still maced us and they still used the water cannon on whoever they wanted to\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 on everybody that was within their reach everybody and the fires that were started to protect everybody to warm people up\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 those fires that were set to warm people up because there was no warming station at that site were targeted by the police\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 were targeted by the water cannons \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 the fires that were keeping us warm they intended on extinguishing the fires that were there for warmth and that was there intent we didnt start the fires only the warming stations the fires that were started randomly out in the field those were by the tear gas canisters that they were shooting off there they were shooting canisters at us into the crowd everybody at one point thought they were trapped on the bridge because lights were coming over from the south of us and those turned out to be our own warriors our own water protectors our own horse riders to support us they stood up on the hill on both sides of the bridge on the south end and we were down at the bottom on the bridge up against the razor wire i asked them to stop repeatedly repeatedly they wouldnt stop they just kept going activists gather in seattle to protest the dakota access pipeline september  john duffy flickr but the thing that really hurt me the most is when they were trying to put out the fires that were literally saving peoples lives i had got knocked down and was totally drenched in water i walked over to the fire to warm up and i was only there long enough to empty the water out of my shoes and then they started targeting the fires so the protectors put up a shield and for thirty seconds they stood there with a continuous blast of water and they were totally drenched and then they all split first the water hit the fire and there was so much steam and smoke that came out of there we were blinded but there were two of us and we grabbed one of those teflon mylar body armors and we stretched it between us and we knelt down on it and held it between us we crouched together we covered one end of the fire and we just sat there and we prayed and they kept putting the water over us until we were completely drenched again over and over and i could hear a young girl when the smoke cleared she was saying grab the logs grab the logs and so people ran over they grabbed the logs out of the fire and they ran a few yards south put them together and started another fire so people could warm up before they were taken to the medic tents because there were hundreds of people soaking wet they werent dressed in wool when i make a call out for clothing its not for any cotton its not for polyester its for waterproof jackets and theres hardly any waterproof tents at all snow pants snow bibs anything thats waterproof and wool we need wool sweaters wool socks wool gloves wool jackets those are the things that we need right now i wish the red cross would show up i really do wish that whoever has power to send the red cross over there would we could do that because we are in a state of emergency thats how it was on the front line the nodapl water protectors took nonviolent direct action by locking themselves to construction equipment this is happy american horse from the sicangu nation hailing from rosebud august   desiree kane wikipedia db its really important \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 you sort of hit this really hard but just to underline it\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 because places like npr and the local police are saying that they had the water there because you all were starting fires and that you were throwing molotov cocktails that was the story that was coming out of the police and the local press you want to talk a little bit more about that ca im not afraid to call a liar to their face if theyre going to post things like that they should be standing on the front lines getting eyewitness testimony instead of just passing on the lies that the sheriff \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 and the governor of north dakota and the dapl are putting out because they are taking their own words and using them against the people to not know the truth and that should be a crime it should be if i was lying to get people to hurt other people would i be called a good person would i be fit to wear a uniform would i be fit to lead a state i dont think so not according to the values that america claims that it follows and so npr get on the front line take your own video because you werent there so i would like all these major media outlets to quit reprinting lies that are undocumented undocumented statements from the police all that happened is our security wanted to open that road because it is a public road and thats what they said to us when we had our vehicles parked on it on october th they said go on they said we need to open the road its a public road move your cars so why cant we move those  trucks off the bridge its a public road thats how it all started db but those are two burnt trucks ca that the military forces had placed there themselves the north dakota officials put those there and they started them on fire and before they left they said please stay away from the vehicles they have propane inside of them theyre explosive devices which of course made everybody to move back from the bridge and they left them there and then they put razor wire which is also unconstitutional you cannot use that type of razor wire i mean you only see those in war zones you dont see them in the united states but im starting to feel were in a war zone so its a battle people we need bodies up front we need the world to know that water is a precious commodity and it is sacred to natives when you understand its relationship to life you will understand the sacredness of it and we need your support we need this economy to stop being the oil and gas industries its not good for our country we need to divest from fossil fuels and start being a leader in the world by adopting a green policy and getting new jobs for these people who are in the oil industry thank you for

            " b'washington  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   when president trumps new middle east envoy began haggling over the details of an agreement with israel to curb construction of jewish settlements in the west bank they turned to a politically improbable adviser yael lempert a    diplomat who worked on the issue in barack obamas white house when mr trump met with the leaders of japan britain and canada he included thomas a shannon jr another career diplomat who rose to the no  post in mr obamas state department and when secretary of state rex w tillerson traveled to turkey this past week to rally support for the military campaign against the islamic state he took along brett h mcgurk who coordinated that effort as mr obamas special envoy these diplomats are part of a rare cohort in the trump administration holdovers from the obama years whose skills knowledge and bureaucratic finesse have enabled them to survive even thrive in an administration determined to purge all vestiges of its predecessor anytime there is a change in administrations career government officials face a tricky transition but that process has been particularly difficult under mr trump because of the insurgent nature of his campaign and his deep suspicion of the permanent bureaucracy while these diplomats have held on through multiple transfers of power in washington navigating this new administration poses special challenges ms lempert has come under fire from people on the israeli right who accuse her of continuing to push mr obamas    policies and mr shannons ability to get along with mr trumps inner circle has rankled some in the state department which has become a hotbed of dissent against the new president and his policies theyre relying on these people for sheer expertise said elliott abrams a republican   elder who was briefly considered for the post of deputy secretary of state but there is a danger here you have to make a judgment about whether the career person was so embedded in the previous administration that they need to go immediately  the status of obama holdovers remains a source of tension within the national security council since the inauguration in january mr trumps aides have pushed to get rid of many of them in part because they question whether people who worked for mr obama can be loyal to mr trump it is unclear whether the new national security adviser lt gen h r mcmaster is resisting these efforts though he has made a point of meeting with the career staff the problem is compounded by severe delays at the white house in filling jobs so far it has nominated people for only  of  key executive branch positions according to a tally by the nonpartisan center for presidential transition at the partnership for public service the delays are particularly acute in the national security field where the white house is confronting crises like the military campaign against the islamic state even before his secretary of state mr tillerson was confirmed mr trump had signed an executive order barring visitors from seven predominantly muslim countries and moved to revive peace negotiations between israel and the palestinians the travel ban thrust mr shannon whose title is under secretary of state for political affairs but who was then serving as acting secretary of state into an awkward spot the white house barely consulted the state department before issuing the order and it relied on mr shannon to rally his colleagues  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   many of whom bitterly opposed the order  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   to enforce it white house officials some of whom had expected the state department to actively undermine the president said they were surprised by the speed with which it issued instructions to consular offices worldwide they credit mr shannon  with overseeing that response he was a rock that weekend said stephen k bannon the presidents chief strategist really came to the forefront with leadership judgment and class folks think very highly of him  mr shannon also stood in for mr tillerson in the presidents meetings with prime ministers theresa may of britain shinzo abe of japan and justin trudeau of canada at the news

job as a foreign service officer we take an oath to the constitution and that constitution is all about respect for our laws and for the will of our people he said we have to respect the decision of the american people  a   veteran of the foreign service mr shannon served in the national security council during the george w bush administration where he became a favorite of mr bushs secretary of state condoleezza rice he also served as assistant secretary for western hemisphere affairs under mr bush and mr obama a job in which he won the trust of secretary of state hillary clinton i am not the least bit surprised he is one of the last men standing said daniel restrepo a former senior director in the national security council who worked with mr shannon hes both an effective diplomat and an effective bureaucrat with an agreeable personality  arturo valenzuela who succeeded him as assistant secretary noted that mr shannon was a fan of nascar that helps give him a common touch which mr valenzuela said might appeal to the people in mr trumps circle even though he has a doctorate in history from oxford certainly mr shannon has built bridges to mr tillerson who recently asked him to stay on as under secretary traditionally the   post for a career diplomat for ms lempert who has been posted to jerusalem and advised mrs clintons cabinet successor john kerry on his dealings with prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel the appeal to mr trumps advisers was her experience in the complex   world of   negotiations her colleagues say she is well connected on both sides and is viewed as an honest broker though in israel critics fault her for what they say was her role in mr obamas campaign to pressure mr netanyahu to freeze settlements as it happens mr trump  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   through his special envoy jason d greenblatt  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   is now pushing the israeli leader to slow down construction as well and mr greenblatt a lawyer who worked for the trump organization and has no experience in middle east diplomacy decided to keep ms lempert on to advise him on the ins and outs of that negotiation ms lempert who is jewish and also served in the bush administration played a major role in negotiating a  billion military aid package for israel on behalf of the obama administration still after reports surfaced that mr netanyahus aides were suspicious of her involvement in the talks the prime ministers office felt obliged to issue a statement saying it had no objection to her mr greenblatt in a statement said i have been ably supported by the extremely   officials at the national security council including n s c senior director yael lempert  she declined to comment as did colleagues from the obama administration some said they worried that praise from them would hurt her with her new bosses a few of mr mcgurks former colleagues demurred from commenting for the same reason but of all the obama holdovers he has had perhaps the smoothest transition in part that is because mr mcgurk  has been working on iraq and related issues through three administrations he also clerked for chief justice william h rehnquist which republicans view as a valuable credential this past week he was at mr tillersons side in the turkish capital ankara advising him on the bewildering politics of the   coalition against the islamic state the united states plans to use a combined force of arab and kurdish forces to mount an assault on raqqa the islamic state stronghold in syria but the turks who are fighting kurdish militants at home are balking because they view the kurdish units as terrorists mr mcgurk organized a recent meeting of coalition members in washington in addition to his network of contacts in the region he has forged close ties to the pentagon including to defense secretary jim mattis by virtue of his experience he has almost      knowledge said peter d feaver who worked with mr mcgurk in the   national security council in bretts case he has proven he can be a loyal team player on very different teams'\n",

            " b'submit home this month popular  reasons why you should try photography as a hobby  reasons why you should try photography as a hobby photography really is one of the most rewarding hobbies a man could pursue ness nomadison ness is a thirtysomething american with almost a decade of experience living and traveling across asia hes a strong believer in pursuing ones passions continual selfimprovement and just being the best man he can be he runs his own website nessthenomadcom  november   lifestyle have you ever had a curiosity in photography yet you werent sure if its a hobby really worthy of your limited time then this article was written for you as i was also once in your shoes i picked up a dslr camera for the first time back in  which awoke a passion inside me that i never even knew was there three and half years later im here to tell you just a few of the many benefits and realizations ive experienced by taking on this timeless hobby here are eight reasons photography might just be the most meaningful hobby youve overlooked your entire life  an opportunity to flex your creative muscle in order to be balanced human beings i believe people need to be physically healthy spiritually awake and creatively expressive photography just like writing and film is a selfless way to be creative while also giving something back to the world the way we interpret our world changes from individual to individual and photography provides a medium for people to express themselves ask ten different photographers to photograph the same thing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a city for example \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and be prepared to see ten wildly different visions of the same subject in our sensoryoverload world it feels good to create something thats uniquely you  appreciate and understand your surroundings more i now find myself seeing everything around me in rectangular frames\\xe2\\x80\\x93a takeaway from having to frame so many pictures over the years oh those people over there would fit perfectly into a  box or that building over there would look perfect boxed in from this angle my eyes are now sharper than ever but i also find myself observing and appreciating all the little things around me i always have to keep my camera nearby because i often want to photograph something ive noticed in my daily routine the pattern on a sewer lid a reflection in a puddle birds perched in a tree and so forth my prephotographer self just like most of the rest of the world would have walked right past these things without a care in the world yet now i can be entertained from the most minuscule and simple things especially if my camera is handy the world is full of photogenic things if can just teach yourself to notice them  help preserve history since its inception photography has always been one of the most moving ways to preserve history in our rapidly changing modern times photos touch people in a way other media cant both photography and video are both visual arts but photographs differ in that they capture merely one frame of what is going on yet one frame is all one needs to feel taken back to another time with the advent of the smartphone photography is as accessible as ever while this sounds good on paper the truth is our worlds becoming more and more flooded with garbage and narcissistic photographs our world needs more adventurous and welltrained photographers out there taking photos of the modern world we live in and the rapid changes its undergoing these are the photos that will be cherished decades down the road not all the shitty selfies that bog down social media  travel experiences will be more meaningful photography goes with traveling like bread goes with butter it took me nearly five years of traveling internationally to finally get serious about doing photography on my trips and after i got started i never looked back rather than traveling for escapism and hedonism im traveling to learn about and document our world as a result my trips feel much more meaningful and fulfilling than they ever did before the way you see and come to understand a country as a photographer is quite different than if you werent one i now divide my history of travel experiences into two separate groups\\xe2\\x80\\x93the trips i had before i owned a dslr camera and the trips i had after buying one photography is so fun and addicting that i find myself wanting to go back to all those predslr camera destinations even the ones i didnt enjoy all that much just so i can reexperience them with a camera in hand  an opportunity to meet new people one thing i always try to do when i travel is meet fellow photographers whether they be foreign or local i appreciate talking to people with an observational eye as they can provide me with unique insight that nonphotographers rarely can but photography doesnt just help you meet other photographers it helps you meet other people from all walks of life ive had regular people on the street come up and talk to me once they saw i was taking photos ive also met people from online for no other reason than they liked my work being a good photographer can also be a great way to meet women theyre not gonna start blowing you as soon as they see your awesome pictures but dont be surprised if you discover some newfound female admiration once your excellent photography skills are out in the open and if you can make a woman look beautiful in a photo shell admire you in a way you never imagined  a blog with an edge in the diverse world of independently run blogs how many bloggers do you know who can both write well and photograph well i can literally only think of one  and the fact that this blogger is just as good at utilizing a camera as he is at wielding a pen or rather a keyboard puts his website in a league of its own in terms of quality content though i still highly respect the good bloggers out there for their amazing writing skills and insights i think theyre doing both their readers and websites a great disservice by merely using stock photos or shitty shotwithacellphone photos in their articles readers can definitely tell the difference when a blogger takes all of their own photos with a nice dslr camera start taking nice dslrshot photos and see for yourself how they can enhance your articles theyll give you just that much more of an edge over all the other bloggers who dont  youll also have an edge over  of others on social media and dating sites since everyone else is posting lame smartphonetaken shots all over their social media accounts your dslrshot photos could shine like diamonds in the rough the same way you stand above  of other men by lifting weights regularly the same advantage can be expected by not taking cheap shortcuts with your social mediabound photography your facebook instagram and twitter accounts will all look better than ever before this is also true for dating websites and apps where most chumps just take some lame mirror selfies with their smartphone and then upload them to their accounts dudes with welltaken nontraditional photos stand out big time dont just take my word for it as there has actually been plenty of discussion about these benefits over at the roosh v forum  and although they can be very helpful you dont actually need another photographer with you to get some good shots of yourself rather all you need is your camera an autofocus lens a tripod a remote shutter and a creative eye  a resumeenhancing marketable skill photography isnt just mentally rewarding it can also be financially rewarding if you play your cards right the field of profitable photography may be vast and highly competitive but one things for sure \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the demand for new photographs is infinite the world never stops turning after all stock portrait wedding wildlife travel sports and news photography are just a few of the most in demand and profitable niches but if you really wanna make money selling your photographs you gotta make a name for yourself by sharpening your skills and networking with the right people a great photographer who no one knows exists wont make any money my father is an outdoorsman slash wildlife photographer with decades of experience tens of thousands of photos and a giant network of contacts from his industry it seems like magazine and website editors are always knocking on his door because they know he probably has a nice shot of exactly what theyre looking for often all he has to do is dig through his archives and boom\\xe2\\x80\\x93hes made  bucks conclusion stop dreaming about it and just give photography a shot already borrow your friend or a family members dslr camera for the weekend and just get out there and take pictures of anything that strikes your fancy photography takes decades to master but it all begins with a single click of the shutter button yet sometimes all it takes is one little click to realize youve been missing out on something very big and meaningful your entire life youll never know until you try'\n",
            " b'on thursdays breitbart news daily siriusxm host alex marlow asked breitbart news senior editor at large peter schweizer about allegations that hillary clintons  campaign chairman john podesta may have violated federal law through his dealings with the russians schweizer said podesta has a very interesting relationship with russia going back to when hillary clinton was secretary of state   when she was secretary of state he was an adviser he sat on her foreign policy advisory board we know from the podesta emails that he was talking to her all the time on everything from speeches to personnel decisions to policy positions schweizer elaborated in  he joins the executive board of this small energy company in massachusetts called joule energy schweizer recalled and joule energy about two months after he joins the executive board gets a large infusion of cash they get one billion rubles which is about  to  million invested from russia it comes from a very unusual entity this entity called rusnano   rusnano is this   investment fund called putins child by the russian science ministry so it shows you how connected this fund is he explained they actually buy an equity stake in this john   company which they can do you can raise the question of why theyre doing it while hes advising hillary clinton but they can legally do that  the problem for podesta becomes when he joins the obama white house as counselor to the president in  he continued in order to do that hes got to file those large cumbersome but i think essential financial disclosure forms where you list what boards are you on that you are connected to or have been connected to in the last year what entities youre also required to disclose your stock holdings   in the case of podesta there are two omissions one of them is the way the joule was structured it has three corporate boards it has one based in massachusetts one based in the netherlands and then it has a holding company john podesta according to corporate records was on all three of those boards he only listed two of them on his financial disclosure he omitted probably the most important one which was the holding company said schweizer now you could say okay maybe it was just an omission he listed two of the three thats not bad he granted the problem is that he failed to disclose what he did with the   shares of stock that he had in the company that were given to him as a board member he gave them to his daughter through an llc  theres a question of whether she actually owned them  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   and by that i mean the podesta emails show that he had a   email conversation with joule energy executives and people connected with them even though he ostensibly didnt own stock anymore but he failed to disclose that transaction he failed to disclose the   shares he owned that he gave to his daughter that is a direct clear violation of what you are supposed to disclose on these federal forms schweizer said marlow noted there have been zero pieces of hard evidence connecting the trump campaign to the russian government while there is so much evidence much of it uncovered by you connecting the clintons with the russian government   and yet the media is obsessed with one and not the other he said schweizer found the disparity of coverage interesting as well im a big believer that you need to investigate and look into things particularly if youre talking about foreign governments or foreign entities trying to influence our politicians he declared what we know right now about the russia story as it relates to trump is the relationship as it were amounts to meetings that some trump officials had with people from russia those trump officials never really made it into the trump administration  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   with the exception of michael flynn who left pretty quickly he pointed out  the thesis that everybody is operating on is the russians helped trump win and trump is going to do all these favors for russia the problem is when you look at the personnel decisions whos running russia policy in the united states  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   whether thats general mattis at the pentagon whether that is mcmaster the national security adviser whether thats the cia director whether thats the director of russia policy on the national security council whos a very solid scholar from the brookings institution  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   none of these are remotely  he said  all you have is sort of this concern that the russians were hacking during the election which i think is a legitimate concern and a theory that hasnt been proved that there was a connection between the trump campaign and the russian government theres just been no evidence of that he noted  my point is both should be looked into but you actually have very substantial things that went on when hillary clinton was secretary of state that number one included the transfer of money to the clintons and to john podesta and number two very serious favors done by the hillary clinton state department to the russians including technology transfer et cetera he said  the kind of scenario that people envision happened with trump happened in the clinton state department and yet there seems to be a lack of interest in pursuing and investigating precisely what those relationships were and how everything was carried out schweizer observed peter schweizer is a senior editor at large for breitbart news president of the government accountability institute and author of the   clinton cash the untold story of how and why foreign governments and businesses helped make bill and hillary rich breitbart news daily airs on siriusxm patriot  weekdays from  a m to  a m eastern listen'\n",
            " b'istanbul  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   when the army cut off traffic in istanbul on friday night by shutting two bridges in the opening moments of a coup the municipality ordered ferries to work overtime city trucks blocked roads near army barracks buses and subways operated free of charge and local officials and mosque preachers helped mobilize government supporters to the streets and when president recep tayyip erdogan finally emerged in public after uncertain hours in which he narrowly missed being seized at a seaside hotel by soldiers trying to topple his government he flew not to the capital ankara but to istanbul where he remained throughout the weekend and on monday ankara may be the seat of turkeys government but it was mr erdogans grip on istanbul a city he once governed as mayor that was crucial in putting down the coup in the failed coups aftermath it was in the streets mosques and public squares in istanbul that his islamist supporters raucously celebrated and where mr erdogan consolidated his hold on power the two cities in many ways represent turkeys deep divisions istanbul owns the hearts of the islamists and is turkeys showcase to the world while ankara is a special place for secular turks istanbuls becoming almost the second capital of the country has been very instrumental in preventing the coup said yusuf muftuoglu who was an adviser to the former president abdullah gul and briefly for mr erdogan the drama of the failed coup mostly played out across two urban spaces and the skies overhead  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   istanbul the sprawling megacity that symbolizes the countrys past as the seat of islamic empire and ankara the utilitarian capital a onetime anatolian backwater built up by modern turkeys secular founder mustafa kemal ataturk much of the violence occurred in ankara where different factions of the armed forces battled over government buildings but the events in istanbul proved crucial in fending off the coup it was there that two private news channels broadcast   coverage and gave a platform to elected leaders including mr erdogan during his time in power mr erdogan has spent far more time in istanbul than previous presidents and has overseen the construction of turkeys largest mosque in the city he has also built up the police force much of which is based in istanbul by stocking the force with loyalists and purging suspected enemies he created a counterweight to the military which has a history of carrying out coups against civilian governments and it was largely the police special forces that defended the government over the weekend confronting the renegade military factions in the days before the attempted coup a palpable sense of melancholy could be felt when walking through the city whose singularity is measured in numbers seven hills two continents the capital of three former empires turks call it huzun a rich   word that means melancholy and a lot more loss sadness spiritual anguish turkeys most famous novelist orhan pamuk used it to describe istanbul in the dreary years after the fall of the ottoman empire the word is back in the citys lexicon now as years of optimism about turkeys growing power on the world stage give way to anxiety over terrorism and internal conflicts after the coup was decisively put down and mr erdogans supporters flooded the streets and city squares over the weekend to celebrate a sense of buoyancy returned to the streets but the joy masked a deep unease that has enveloped the city istanbul where ancient mosques and churches jostle with gleaming skyscrapers and   shopping malls to define an evolving cityscape was reshaped by mr erdogans islamist government which created a glistening image of the city that is now threatened by instability the government embraced turkeys ottoman and islamic past as a mythical time of harmony and reimagined istanbul as turkeys true capital investing heavily in public works projects new shopping malls and office buildings ankara took a back seat i think the city was presented as this perfect dream without its problems said kaya genc a novelist and essayist who wrote about huzun after the recent  attack on istanbuls main airport which left dozens of people dead maybe it was a lie but we miss it  now he said is the return of the real istanbul  by that he meant a city whose mood is more in sync with its unstable past of military coups political violence and economic crisis in recent years the government built an image of istanbul as an urban wonderland of fascinating history and great architecture and cuisine and tourism boomed mr genc said that like many other liberals and intellectuals he bought in to the vision a past was reinvented and repackaged as this great multicultural history where there are no conflicts he said even before the failed military coup all that was clouded by spillover from the syrian civil war  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   terrorism and a flood of refugees hundreds of thousands in istanbul alone  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   that set the city on edge everything is being arabized said karaca borar who owns an antiques shop on one of the crooked cobbled streets in european istanbul and supplied many of the items that fill a nearby museum owned by mr pamuk that is based on his novel museum of innocence  he said he was tired of hearing the arabic greeting of salaam aleikum on the streets and tired of so many syrians in general it is a widely shared sentiment when mr erdogan recently said turkey should offer citizenship to syrians a   secular newspaper called syrians vermin in a   headline asked about the mood of the city which before the coup attempt had faced several devastating terrorist attacks for which the islamic state was blamed mr borar said terrible terrible terrible  were not happy he said im not at ease  he continued we were the only secular decent country in a bad region now we are like one of those arab states  with so many threats even the weather can set off panic a clap of thunder sending people scampering for cover people walking the streets are scrutinized for what they are wearing and what they are carrying a backpack could be a bomb a sweater or jacket in summertime could conceal a vest of explosives nowadays it seems all of turkeys old conflicts  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   most prominently the divide between religious and secular turks  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   and many new ones are coming to the fore the most dramatic was the long night of uncertainty as fighter jets buzzed the sky gunfire echoed across the city and protesters mobilized as the military tried to secure the city but even before that turkeys traumas were playing out across istanbul in bitter conversations about politics in painful decisions to move away or in to gated communities in smatterings of protests quickly put down by the police and in new debates over the use of public spaces three years ago protesters in gezi park in taksim square in european istanbul where mr erdogans supporters rallied over the weekend rose up to oppose plans to convert the park into a shopping mall the protests became a widespread challenge to his rule which is growing increasingly autocratic it produced no lasting political changes but it did save the park but maybe not for long in recent comments that seemed designed to provoke his enemies mr erdogan said he could revive the plan on a recent afternoon ali erdogan a retired military man in his late s who is not related to the president sat on a bench in gezi park where the city has planted new trees blossoming with pink flowers and told how his life had improved since mr erdogan came to power more than a decade ago he pulled out his card for retirees for free rides on istanbuls subway which has been modernized in recent years as has turkeys health care system everything is new and shiny he said more important he said he can freely express his religion something he was unable to do when turkeys secular elite ruled the country for decades he said when he was in the military the guardian of secularism he had to conceal his religiosity i had to lie that i prayed five times a day he said i had to find a secret corner to pray  the citys most conservative district is fatih in the old city across the golden horn waterway that divides european istanbul there mr erdogan spoke at a funeral on sunday and rallied his supporters to keep gathering in the citys public squares it is also where three suicide attackers who carried out the airport bombings lived in an orange apartment building but the area is far from homogeneous in one gentrifying enclave of fatih in a neighborhood called balat   cafes and quirky antique shops have sprouted on the narrow streets raising tensions and testing the limits of social diversity istanbul used to be like a village said hikmet bardok  a longtime resident i dont recognize it anymore a lot of people who live here are poor and these rich people are coming in an looking for places to park their ferrari  mr bardok said he quit drinking in  when he turned to religion and blamed secular turks for the countrys polarization because they are arrogant and disrespectful  now that they are moving in to his neighborhood he is worried that in five to  years this place is going to turn into amsterdam  mr genc meanwhile has been thinking of writing a book on what he calls the new istanbul a chronicle of the artificial distant new neighborhoods that have built up in the citys outer reaches during mr erdogans tenure mr erdogan once enjoyed the support of many of istanbuls intellectuals and elites some of whom now call him a dictator even though they opposed a coup they once thought him capable of healing the countrys divides and basked in the optimism that flowed through istanbul now in the aftermath of the coup attempt they are left to wonder if mr erdogan will turn more autocratic or perhaps seize the time to patch up relations with segments of the society he has alienated that will become clearer in the days and weeks ahead for now turks are simply trying to make sense of their dizzying weekend the morning after the coup attempt mr genc woke early and went for a walk along the bosporus in the background was the waterway he wrote in an essay for the new york times a burning sun and two bridges that span two continents

            " b'by augustina ursino matthew gage downingpowers passed away on october   he was  \\xc2\\xbd months old and died less than  days after receiving  vaccines after matthews lifeless body was taken to the hospital his parents were kept from seeing him to say their goodbyes a month and a half later he was returned cremated then matthews parents were denied a copy of his autopsy report matthews mother crystal downingpowers found a vaccine injury attorney to help her file a vaccine injury claim this vaccine injury attorney was handling this case for six months and then one day he sent crystal a letter in the mail saying he didnt have enough evidence regarding the death of matthew so he was dropping them that was it there was no further correspondence from him with no progression on their case matthews parents were further shattered they were unsure of what to do next because the deadline to file a vaccine injury claim is two years after a parent loses their baby to vaccines this left them with barely any time to find another vaccine injury attorney to help them crystal was distraught and in tears feeling more helpless than ever at this point the vactruth team immediately helped her find another vaccine injury attorney it is very difficult for any vaccine injury attorney to win a vaccine injury case involving a child who died after being vaccinated nearly seventy percent of vaccine injury claims get denied it takes a lot of time to fight these cases and some attorneys just arent willing to put in the time or effort others just dont have the experience thankfully this new attorney has been fully supportive and understanding of the situation and is willing to fight for matthews family crystal was thankful that her new attorney filed their claim in september  less than one month before the deadline he also submitted a request to receive matthews autopsy report being denied to his parents weeks continued to pass after the request was put in in january  matthews autopsy report was finally provided in full to the lawyer detailing the vaccines matthew received prior to his death the time he was vaccinated and the time he passed away matthews death was ruled undetermined crystal was thankful the autopsy report was finally available but had no words to describe the pain this has caused them and the frustration of having to wait more than two years and three months to get a copy of their sons autopsy report when her lawyer viewed the report he mentioned of the many autopsy reports he has reviewed viewing matthews was one of the most difficult to look at even he felt it would be too much for crystal to look at or for anyone to look at the images of her son in that report remain unseen by crystal to this day after losing her son crystal wants us to know she is optimistic they will win their case once they do win she wants to go as far as she can go to open peoples eyes she has seen  babies die in the past year from vaccines even though the vaccines are denied as the cause of death parents know the truth this breaks her heart to see this and makes her relive the worst nightmare in her own life crystal wants people to know that these innocent children dying from vaccines needs to stop and if she has to be that person to stop this then she will be crystal has since given birth to their rainbow baby wyatt this term represents a baby born after a baby lost wyatt is an extremely healthy child she has witnessed firsthand like many parents before her how he is the healthiest child of hers because he is unvaccinated crystal reminds us that none of their children will ever receive any further vaccines and she has filed vaccine exemptions for them in california she is also disgusted that sb passed after what happened to her son it became clearer to her that these politicians dont care about peoples health because when the vaccines harm the injured get ignored matthews parents always feel a part of them missing their precious gift of life is dead now because of poisonous injections that didnt protect him from any disease we are outraged at what is happening to families and at those who are in a position to do something to change things but continue to do nothing to help the vaccineinjured community and to prevent these tragedies from continuing we are incredibly sorry for matthews loss his parents live each day with so much pain knowing the vaccines took the life of their fourth son matthews brothers suffer each day too they miss their brother tremendously matthew would be turning  years old today we hope you never forget him and what his short life has taught us original publication february   parents in california are distraught after losing their infant son after being vaccinated he died in his sleep and was taken to the hospital already deceased hospital staff ruled his death as sudden infant death syndrome the couple was told an autopsy was required to be performed on their son after returning home waiting to get an update they never received one numerous phone calls were made to get answers weeks went by finally they received verbal confirmation and told their son was best not to be seen prior to being cremated because of the condition he was in once cremated they could pick up the remains of their child from the crematory they were not given the chance to say their goodbyes more than one year and four months have passed and the family has yet to receive his autopsy report it turns out their son was given a vaccine not approved for his age and an extra dose of the hepatitis b vaccine that he shouldnt have received until later on this harrowing story is a reminder that vaccines can be lethal parents shall maintain the rights to choose what medical interventions they feel are safe for their child after all they are the ones who have to live with the consequences crystal downing shares with us what happened to her son matthew in hopes to remind parents to research vaccines before offering their child to be injected with whatever the doctor says one less baby boy our sweet little fussy bear matthew gage downingpowers was born healthy on april   in the hospital he was given the hepatitis b vaccine after birth thats what they do here in the united states and what the cdc recommends newborns receive following the current schedule his reactions to the shot were deemed normal and i have older children that have been fully vaccinated so i was aware of what to expect i took matthew in for his  month well baby checkup on july   during this appointment he was given  vaccines for dtap  in  polio hib hep b pneumococcal pcv and the oral rotavirus vaccine then i was late getting him to his  month checkup i brought him as soon as i was able on monday october   when matthew was  \\xc2\\xbd months old i brought him in for his  month delayed visit the doctor said they could get him caught up on his shots i thought ok you can do that matthew received  vaccines dtap polio hib pneumococcal hep b and hep a these would be the last vaccines he would ever receive after the shots he didnt have a fever or a low grade one we didnt give him tylenol he was just grumpy and crying some we checked him every hour his temperature stayed normal but he wasnt his happy go lucky self all my kids got grumpy after their shots i didnt call the doctor on tuesday i knew these were typical behaviors after the kids received the vaccines he is my th son we had our other  vaccinated and knew what to expect i thought i would give it another day to see if he was still grumpy but we didnt get to the next day matthew was gone by then he was found lifeless he went to bed that tuesday night and my husband found him wednesday morning my husband zack and i both performed cpr on our son and so did my dad and step mom he had some light pinkishbrown tinged mucous coming from his nose and mouth i wasnt willing to believe he was gone none of us were willing to give up on him my husband called  but they were taking so long i ran my baby to the hospital that was  blocks away i took him to needles hospital which is called colorado river medical center in needles ca the hospital also did cpr on him and said he died of sids soon after i brought him in he had been gone for hours they said they told me he passed sometime between  pm after he was put to bed and  am wednesday morning shortly before he was found my life has been full of heartache since we lost our baby that was the worst day of my life seeing my son that way but still believing he would come back to me hospital staff said i would be under investigation and it was california law when a baby passes to undergo an autopsy from the hospital in needles matthew was transferred from that hospital to the coroners office in san bernardino ca we had chosen to have matthew cremated at a funeral home in san bernardino after leaving matthew at the hospital we were told to go home and wait for an update when the autopsy would be done we planned to see him at the funeral home we picked out after deciding we would have him cremated i was told id be informed when the autopsy was to be done and when it would be completed and that i could view him before being cremated i didnt write down the names of the staff members i left my son with i didnt think of that when it happened but i should have no one called me to inform me what was going on i called numerous times and kept getting the runaround absolutely no one would give me answers weeks went by before i received a call back by this time i was informed matthew was not in a condition id want to remember him in i felt helpless and convinced i should sign a paper letting them cremate him prior to this the funeral home confirmed the remains were matthews they asked me what urn i would like and then confirmed it was him i also sent a picture of him to make sure matthew didnt get brought back to our home in needles california until november   a month and a half after he passed away i dont think they cremated him before telling me but part of me feels they did to cover up his death i will never know but my instincts tell me something was being hidden i think the funeral home did a nice job they were very patient with me they understood why i kept calling them so many times to see if somebody there could tell me what happened to my sons body i didnt know where my sons body was i didnt know what was going on at the coroners office i was never notified whatsoever and to be honest i was really flipping out i wanted to know what was going on with my baby and what answers did they have for me so far the coroner was informed of the vaccines matthew had just received i had even asked the coroner if it was possible the vaccines killed my son the coroner straight lied to my face or more over the phone saying that no it was not the vaccinations that killed him there was only one time they contacted me and that was over how many people had done cpr on him and that was the last time i heard from them i did contact him after we had received his death certificate saying pending investigation still and i asked if they had finished with his autopsy report they told me no i called once more and they told me that they couldnt give me anymore information and that i would have to call the coroners office here in needles california i have done that and still no answer no nothing the coroner said it wasnt my fault and sometimes this just happens i couldnt believe what i was just told it took me a long time to speak up and share my story because of this pain i decided to come forward because i dont want matthew to die in vain because of vaccine manufacturers not doing a better job making safer vaccines before pushing them onto unsuspecting parents and their innocent babies they view as profitable beings why are infants getting so many at one time has it been proven its safe to give these kids all the vaccines they are shooting them up with during these well baby checkups from what ive learned since all of this the answer is no later i learned two of the vaccines given at his last appointment should not have been given to him babies are not supposed to be given the hepatitis a vaccine until at least  year of age and this was given to matthew at   months old i also learned he was given the third dose of hepatitis b too soon matthew wasnt supposed to get that until his next visit during the  month checkup which wouldve also been delayed to space out the shots because we were late getting him the  month vaccines i think it was right after the funeral i learned that they had given him the hep a vaccine too soon when i had learned this it killed me i started blaming my self and still do because i never took the time to know what vaccines were supposed be given to a child at what month how many doses etc i felt because i didnt do the research until after matthew died i was foolish and this was somehow my fault i felt in some way this was my fault because i was late on his vaccinations my thoughts were if i wouldve followed the cdcs schedule and not been late to that  month check up he probably would not have gotten the wrong vaccines now hes gone i do understand he couldve been taken sooner even if the correct vaccines were given on the schedule its just something i live with its been over a year and four months since matthew passed on october   and i still havent gotten the autopsy report that i told them i wanted a copy of i keep getting the run around i went to the doctors office recently and found out the nurse that injected matthew is no longer working there i was told she got fired because she didnt know what she was doing when giving vaccines i said to the office if it turns out his death was because of her ignorance i will be going after them all my son shouldnt have died because you guys were too lazy to train her to give vaccines properly they didnt even apologize to me im just beyond angry at this point i cant wait to get my answers they said my baby is the only one who had passed away since she started working until the end of her working who knows if that is true there couldve been more lives taken and they wouldnt admit it i want to tell other parents they say vaccinations are safe but in reality they arent ask questions and know which vaccines they plan to give to your baby know the risks associated with all of the vaccines they plan to give during the checkup and remember its your choice its your child and whatever you do dont let them mix the vaccines into one needle or give them so many at once because if you dont think this wont harm your child then look at the child i lost it is possible matthew was given dtap ipv hib pcv hep b and hep a in  shots one in his right arm and two in his left leg now im pregnant with my th child i have to stay strong i have too i have to remain less stressed for my family and during my pregnancy i have  boys a hubby and soon my rainbow baby all counting on me to hold this family together in all honesty though sometimes i feel so overwhelmed because i miss matthew so much and people are so unaware how often vaccines take the lives of infants im beyond angry that this has happened to my baby and scared it can happen again with the kids i do have and that ill be forced to vaccinate this unborn baby a bill was currently put forth by our california state politicians to take away my right to exempt my children from further vaccines due to personal beliefs if this passes this would take my parental right away to choose vaccinating my children in the future what they should do is create a new exemption for parents to file that took one for the team we should be able to opt out for that reason alone was it not enough matthew was taken he should be honored by these people but instead they deny his existence by pushing bills that slap parents in the face that have lost their child to vaccines or to those parents with vaccine injured children maybe if they would make safer vaccines more would want to get them my son was injected with  vaccines if you dont know what is in them learn when i did i was shocked and mad at myself for not questioning this before matthew is the reason i opened my eyes to see what vaccines can really do to a baby let alone anyone im not the only one who believes vaccines are not what they claim they are i really hope this opens parents eyes who do vaccinate their children my older son is having a hard time my second son said he is afraid of the shots now and my third son is  years old he just knows his baby brother is gone as for my hubby he keeps it in so its kind of hard to know what he is feeling to this day i still havent received his autopsy report they keep giving me the run around so the investigation is still pending i have filed a report with the vaccine adverse events reporting system vaers ive learned they sometimes dont follow up with parents which prevents them from reporting a reaction until i receive an autopsy report it makes it difficult to file a claim with the national vaccine injury compensation program nvicp i feel they are stalling us because the time frame to file when you lose a child to vaccines is  years its going on a  \\xc2\\xbd years for us we wont give up my son should still be here his shot records dont lie they shouldnt cover up these reactions to vaccines these kids suffer from they should not stifle parents from pursuing the already time consuming and deterring recourse theyve set up talking about the vaccine injury compensation program since i looked into this more ive learned how common it is for babies to die right after getting vaccinated i just want it to be known that this can happen and i hope mothers ask questions first before handing their child over to get shot up how many of us moms helped hold our own child down to keep them restrained while being vaccinated knowing we helped them hurt our own matthews death was a high price to pay in the name of preventing any of these diseases my kid wouldve been fine dealing with i didnt believe a few people who told me this can happen but it did and now i have to live with that for the rest of my life knowing i should have asked questions and researched first before blindly agreeing to them injecting or giving him anything i didnt research i didnt question what vaccines were given to all of my children i had no reason to distrust doctors until now since this happened to matthew my eyes are wide open now now im not afraid to question everything that is done to my children its a parents decision to make to vaccinate their child or not parents need to research both sides for and against then make their decision on the matter my dad told me i didnt get sick till after i started school and had to have those required vaccines after that my dad never vaccinated me again my dad said it a few times before all of this happened but i didnt pay attention i wish i had listened to him i just let the doctors and nurses do what they said was needed no questions asked i thought they would tell me if there were severe risks involved nobody told me anything like that i trusted them with my childs life and wouldve liked to have known that death from vaccination is an associated risk why didnt the doctors or nurse tell me this i really wished i researched and asked questions instead of just trusting the system and doctors and now because i didnt my child is gone there are a lot more parents out there like me some dont come forward due to fact they are afraid of what people would say sometimes people can be really cruel and not understand what parents like me go through i just want his story to be told my hubby and i say thank you to everyone lending their support we are so blessed to have the short time we had with our little fussy bear i hope sharing this will help mothers know it can happen i want it well known im not telling parents not to vaccinate their child im simply saying to research before you vaccinate learn if you choose to vaccinate then that is your choice not someone elses to make because you will be stuck with the consequences dont disrespect parents like me who have lost their child to vaccines and dont disrespect parents of living vaccine injured children our rights to choose these medical interventions need to be preserved it is beyond disturbing that bought politicians think they can choose what gets injected into our children they dont care about your childs health clearly many are dying and getting injured from these vaccines and they turn a blind eye that should tell you something i miss my baby so much a huge part of me was taken when he was i cannot let this happen again i cannot put my other children at risk of being vaccine injured any longer matthew took one for the team and his life didnt matter to those wanting to strip my rights to opt out of further vaccinating why does he not matter why do mild cases involving the measles get reported all over the news but not babies dying after getting the mmr shot or other vaccinations why dont the vaccine injured children matter we miss and love you so much matthew you are always thought of every day you are always in my heart and i will never stop loving you love your momma'\n",

democratic superdelegates securing enough of them to overcome a bruising challenge from senator bernie sanders and turn to a brutal   campaign against donald j trump in a yearlong nomination fight full of surprise twists from the popularity of mr sanders to the success of mr trump the revelation that mrs clinton had clinched the nomination was another startling development  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   especially coming on the eve of major primaries in california new jersey and other states mr sanders added to the drama by refusing to accept the a p survey and vowing to fight on while mr trump argued that he had done more for women than mrs clinton mrs clinton was ebullient but also restrained as she received the news at an uncanny moment  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   almost eight years to the day after she ended her campaign against barack obama before a crowd of many teary women and girls on monday night she shared the breakthrough with a jubilant audience at a campaign stop in long beach calif i got to tell you according to the news we are on the brink of a historic historic unprecedented moment but we still have work to do dont we mrs clinton said we have six elections tomorrow and were going to fight hard for every single vote especially right here in california  like mr obama eight years ago mrs clinton clinched the democratic nomination with the support of hundreds of superdelegates  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   the party insiders democratic officials members of congress major donors and others who help select the nominee under democratic rules these superdelegates  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   approximately  in all  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   are allowed to back any candidate they wish and can change their allegiance any time before the democratic national convention in july mrs clinton has had relationships with many of the superdelegates for years and her campaign began seeking their support as soon as she entered the race last spring mr sanders by contrast has struggled to win their backing mrs clinton and mr sanders competed most aggressively for   pledged delegates  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   the roughly   delegates won through state primaries and caucuses the a p declared mrs clinton the presumptive nominee by reaching out to superdelegates who had not announced which candidate they were supporting and confirming that enough were backing mrs clinton to get her to the magic number of   but her aides were reluctant to proclaim the race over for fear of depressing turnout on tuesday  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   especially in california where the race remains close  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   or appearing to take the victory for granted robby mook mrs clintons campaign manager said the a ps call was an important milestone but indicated mrs clinton did not intend to declare victory until tuesday night when she will clinch not only a win in the popular vote but also the majority of pledged delegates  advisers to mr sanders took a dim view of the math he previously said he would lobby clinton superdelegates to shift their support to him by arguing that he is the partys best chance to defeat mr trump and he particularly plans to target those superdelegates who represent states where mr sanders won primaries and caucuses the advisers speaking on the condition of anonymity said mr sanders was aiming to win the california primary on tuesday to bolster his argument to superdelegates that he is the stronger and more popular candidate than mrs clinton mr sanders speaking on monday night at a rally in san francisco did not acknowledge the news that mrs clinton had clinched the nomination and instead defiantly vowed to continue his candidacy to the convention but he also made clear that tuesdays vote was make or break for the future of his campaign tomorrow is the most important primary in the whole democratic nominating process  \\xe2\\x80\\x94   we are going to win here in california mr sanders said he added that if he could win the tuesday contests in california north dakota south dakota new mexico montana and do well in new jersey his campaign would be going into that convention with enormous momentum  moments before mr sanders took the stage former state senator nina turner of ohio led thousands of supporters in a chant shouting fight on fight on fight on  it was a sentiment shared by many audience members like alex borja  of castro valley calif who said he was happy mr sanders had not conceded to mrs clinton and hoped he would remain in the race through the summer i dont think its fair that they have basically coronated hillary as the nominee from the beginning and at this point bernie still has a chance to win the delegates needed to clinch the nomination at the convention mr borja said he added however that he would vote for mrs clinton if she were the nominee mr sanderss campaign spokesman michael briggs issued a sharply worded statement that refused to accept the a p survey it is unfortunate that the media in a rush to judgment are ignoring the democratic national committees clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer mr briggs said mr trump struck familiar notes on monday night on twitter attacking mrs clinton as unfit for the presidency but he also put his own spin on making history during an interview with fox news i was the one that really broke the glass ceiling on behalf of women more than anybody in the construction industry mr trump said for mrs clinton becoming her partys presumptive nominee is the latest chapter in a remarkable career that has taken her from being the first lady to being one election away from returning to the white house as president she planned a victory rally on tuesday in brooklyn but by the time the a p had called the contest she seemed to already be in a celebratory mood ending a campaign slog that had been expected to come to a close after the early contests but dragged on to just before the final votes were tallied at a shes with us concert at the greek theater in los angeles with john legend christina aguilera and stevie wonder mrs clinton had for weeks hardly hid her eagerness to put the primary contests against mr sanders behind her and to turn her full focus to the presumptive republican nominee mr trump talking to voters at the hawkins house of burgers in the watts section of los angeles mrs clinton promised to take on mr trump all the time and earlier that day she urged mr sanderss supporters to consider the consequences if mr trump captured the white house anyone whos supported me anyone who has supported senator sanders has a lot at stake in this election in preventing donald trump from being our president which i can barely say she told reporters on monday but mrs clinton must also work in the coming weeks to improve her own standing with voters both with mr sanderss hordes of young supporters and with a majority of registered voters who say they do not like or trust her still many democratic allies of mrs clinton did not want to wait until tuesdays primaries to celebrate writing twitter posts and issuing statements hailing her as the nominee and trying to shift the democratic partys focus and the national political conversation to take aim at mr trump jennifer granholm the former michigan governor who now advises a   super pac said in an
